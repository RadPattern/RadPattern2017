\-Welcome to the \-Radiation \-Pattern \-Program (\-Rad\-Pattern101). \-This program is a term project in \-Programming \-Tools course with \-Dr. \-Ricardo \-Taborda at the \-University of \-Memphis in \-Spring 2017.

\-The team members are \-Oluwaseun \-Fadugba, \-Yixin \-Zhang and \-Eric \-Jambo.

\-In this project, we are going to generate the radiation pattern, wave propagation map, and seismic waves at a specific location in the specified grid. \-This program requires the type of force (point force, force dipole, double couple or single couple) that radiation pattern should be generated for. \-The program also requires the type of wave e.\-g. \-P-\/, \-S\-V-\/ or \-S\-H-\/ waves and the rock properties through they propagate.

\-Another aspect of the program is to generate a time-\/map of the wavepropagation with epicentral distance given an input waveform at the source. \-The default source input waveform in this program is a \-Gaussian function.

lastly, we also can display the waveform at a particular epicentral distance after incorporating the influence of radiation pattern for the particular waveform as input.
